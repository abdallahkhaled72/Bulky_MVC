### 👨‍💼 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Payment Terms

The application implements a sophisticated authentication system with four distinct user roles. A key feature is the **differentiated payment processing logic** based on the user's role:

| Role | Responsibilities | Payment Terms |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admin** | Global system administrator. Manages all products, categories, users, and companies. | N/A |
| **Company** | Represents a business selling on the platform. Manages their own product catalog. | **✅ Delayed Payment Approved.** Orders are approved immediately but payment can be delayed for up to 30 days. |
| **Employee** | Works for a **Company**. Can update order statuses and manage products for their company. | **✅ Delayed Payment Approved.** Inherits the payment terms of their associated company. |
| **Customer** | An individual shopper. Browses and purchases items for personal use. | **❌ Immediate Payment Required.** Payment must be completed successfully at the time of checkout using Stripe. |

  # 🏗️ Solution Architecture
  This solution is structured into multiple Class Library projects to enforce a clear **Separation of Concerns** and promote **maintainability**. The architecture follows a layered principle, where each layer has a distinct responsibility and references only the layers it depends on.

# 🔗 Project Dependencies & References
The dependency graph illustrates the clean separation between layers:

```text
BookStore.Web
    ├── Depends on: BookStore.DataAccess
    ├── Depends on: BookStore.Models
    └── Depends on: BookStore.Utility

BookStore.DataAccess
    └── Depends on: BookStore.Models (The DataAccess layer knows about the Models)

BookStore.Utility
    └── Depends on: BookStore.Models (e.g., if EmailSender uses a Model)

BookStore.Models
    └── Has no dependencies. (This is the core of the application)
```

# 📋 Layer Responsibilities

| Layer                | Purpose                                                    | Key Components                                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **BookStore.Web**        | **Presentation Layer**<br>Handles HTTP requests, UI logic, and serves views. | Controllers, Razor Views, JavaScript, CSS               |
| **BookStore.Models**     | **Domain Layer**<br>Contains the core business entities and data contracts. | Entity Classes, ViewModels, Enums                       |
| **BookStore.DataAccess** | **Data Access Layer**<br>Abstracts all database interactions. | DbContext, Repository Pattern, Unit of Work, Migrations |
| **BookStore.Utility**    | **Cross-Cutting Concerns Layer**<br>Holds common services and helpers used across other layers. | Email Service, Payment Gateway Config, Constants        |


The Repository Pattern and Unit of Work are used to abstract the data layer, making the application more flexible and easier to test
